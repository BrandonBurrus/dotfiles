# dotfiles

My personal dotfile configs for working in vim, tmux and zsh ‚ö°Ô∏è

## Setup üöÄ

To properly setup dotfiles with correct version control tracking, run the following:

```bash
git clone \
  --separate-git-dir=$HOME/.myconf \
  https://github.com/BrandonBurrus/dotfiles.git \
  $HOME/myconf-tmp
source ~/myconfig-tmp/.aliases
dot branch master -u origin/master
rm -rf ~/myconf-tmp
(cd ~; dot pull --force)
```

After this, refresh the shell session and the correct dotfiles should now
be available in the home directory.

The above code snippet setups up the dotfiles in a way where the home directory
will not be under direct version control by setting the git directory to a
custom location.

To version control the dotfiles repository, an alias for the git command has been
created and is named `dot`.
